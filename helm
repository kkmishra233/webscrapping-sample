Introduction to Helm Charts in Kubernetes

What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment and management of applications. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications using pre-configured templates called Helm charts.

Helm provides:

Templating: Allows you to reuse Kubernetes manifests across multiple environments.

Dependency Management: Helps you install dependent applications alongside your main application.

Version Control: Makes it easy to roll back to a previous version if needed.

Configuration Management: Lets you override default settings using values.yaml.

Why Use Helm?

Before Helm, managing Kubernetes applications involved writing lengthy YAML files and manually applying them using kubectl. With Helm, you can:

1. Reduce redundancy with reusable templates.


2. Manage multiple environments with different configurations.


3. Install complex applications with one command.


4. Easily upgrade or roll back releases.


5. Share and distribute applications via Helm repositories.

Understanding Helm Architecture

Helm has two major components:

1. Helm CLI – The command-line tool for managing charts.


2. Helm Library (Go-based) – Renders templates and interacts with the Kubernetes API server.



A Helm Chart is a collection of YAML templates and metadata files that define a Kubernetes application.

Helm Chart Directory Structure

When you create a Helm chart, the default structure looks like this:

mychart/
  ├── charts/          # (Optional) Dependency charts
  ├── templates/       # Contains Kubernetes YAML templates
  │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   ├── service.yaml
  │   ├── ingress.yaml
  │   ├── _helpers.tpl
  ├── values.yaml      # Default values for the templates
  ├── Chart.yaml       # Metadata about the chart
  ├── README.md        # Documentation

Key Files

Chart.yaml – Contains metadata like chart name, version, and description.

values.yaml – Defines configurable values for the deployment.

templates/ – Stores Kubernetes manifests as Jinja-like templates.

charts/ – Holds dependencies (other Helm charts).

Using Helm in Kubernetes

1. Installing Helm

To install Helm, run:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

2. Creating a Helm Chart

helm create mychart

This generates a boilerplate Helm chart.

3. Installing an Application Using a Chart

helm install myrelease mychart/

myrelease is the unique name for this deployment.

mychart/ is the chart directory.


4. Listing Installed Helm Releases

helm list

5. Upgrading a Helm Release

Modify values.yaml and apply changes:

helm upgrade myrelease mychart/

6. Rolling Back a Release

If an upgrade causes issues, roll back to the previous version:

helm rollback myrelease 1

(Here, 1 is the revision number.)

7. Uninstalling a Helm Release

helm uninstall myrelease


---

Customizing Helm Charts

1. Modifying Values.yaml

Helm charts use values.yaml to store configuration parameters. Example:

replicaCount: 3
image:
  repository: nginx
  tag: latest
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 80

Override these values at install time:

helm install myrelease mychart/ --set replicaCount=5

2. Using Helm Templates

Helm templates use Go template syntax:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-deployment
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"


---

Managing Dependencies in Helm

If your application requires other services (like a database), define dependencies in Chart.yaml:

dependencies:
  - name: postgresql
    version: "10.3.11"
    repository: "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"

To fetch dependencies:

helm dependency update


---

Helm Repositories

Adding a Helm Repository

To use third-party charts (e.g., from Bitnami):

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

Searching for Charts

helm search repo nginx

Installing a Chart from a Repository

helm install myrelease bitnami/nginx


---

Helm Best Practices

1. Use values.yaml for Configurations – Avoid hardcoding values in templates.


2. Use _helpers.tpl for Reusable Code – Store reusable template functions.


3. Keep Chart Versions Updated – Define proper versioning in Chart.yaml.


4. Use Helm Hooks for Lifecycle Events – Helm supports pre-install, post-install, etc.


5. Always Test Charts Locally – Before deploying, run:

helm template mychart/




---

Real-World Use Cases

1. Deploying Microservices – Helm makes it easy to deploy and scale multiple services.


2. Managing Configuration for Different Environments – Override values for dev, staging, and prod.


3. CI/CD Pipelines – Integrate Helm with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or ArgoCD for automated deployments.


4. Air-Gapped Deployments – Package Helm charts for offline installations.


5. Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments – Use Helm to deploy workloads across Kubernetes clusters.

Conclusion

Helm is an essential tool for managing Kubernetes applications efficiently. It simplifies deployment, updates, and rollbacks, making Kubernetes management more scalable and maintainable. By mastering Helm, teams can streamline their Kubernetes operations, ensure reproducibility, and reduce human error.
